			<h3>Michelle Banawan</h3>
			<p>Asian Institute of Management
			<br />C1: Sub-Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education/Intelligent Tutoring Systems (AIED/ITS)</p>
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">Learning from Generative AI for Cognitive and Pedagogical Advancement</p>
			<p>
			In an era where Generative AI (GAI) is rapidly transforming education, understanding the cognitive models and knowledge-building processes behind these tools is crucial for educators. This keynote explores the role reversal of learning from GAI—not just in terms of the output it generates but through an in-depth examination of its underlying cognition and reasoning frameworks. By dissecting how AI models like ChatGPT O1 process knowledge, construct reasoning paths, and engage in problem-solving, we can glean insights that reshape how we approach instructional scaffolding and educational design.
			<br><br>
			The talk will delve into how educators can leverage this understanding to develop more sophisticated scaffolding techniques, informed by GAI’s cognition models. Emphasizing the transition from surface-level interactions to a deeper engagement with AI’s knowledge construction methods, we will explore strategies that educators can adopt to enhance critical thinking, problem-solving, and inquiry-based learning in students.
			<br><br>
			Relevant to ICCE’s mission to advance educational technology, this presentation offers a forward-looking perspective on how generative AI tools provide not just an instructional aid but also a model for developing more effective educational frameworks grounded in cognitive science and AI reasoning.

			<h3>Dragan Gašević</h3>
			<p>Monash University
			<br />C3: ICCE Sub-Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ALT), Learning Analytics and Digital Infrastructure.</p>
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">Getting ready for the age of AI: Developing self-regulated learners</p>
			<p>
			The burgeoning field of generative AI presents both opportunities and challenges for education. While AI offers powerful tools, concerns about information accuracy and how individuals interact with generative AI tools underscore the need for strong self-regulated learning (SRL) skills. This talk explores strategies for educators and education technology developers to foster SRL in students, empowering them to become independent and adaptive learners. Drawing on the findings of multiple empirical studies, it will examine the implications of generative AI on SRL abilities, focusing on how learners can effectively engage in evaluative judgment, apply learning strategies, and solve information problems. The key takeaway is that the use of generative AI tools may limit learners' ability to effectively deploy and develop their SRL skills. The talk will also highlight promising ways to address these limitations. Finally, it will explore potential partnerships to equip educators with the tools needed to prepare learners for an AI-integrated learning landscape.

			<h3>Mirjam Hauck</h3>
			<p>The Open University UK
			<br />C6: ICCE Sub-Conference on Technology Enhanced Language Learning (TELL)</p>
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">Critical Virtual Exchange for Critical Global Citizenship Education</p>
			<p>
			UNESCO’s (2014) broad definition of Global Citizenship Education is centered on the aim to “empower learners to engage and assume active roles, both locally and globally, to face and resolve global challenges and ultimately to become proactive contributors to a more just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, secure and sustainable world” (p. 15). Scholars like Stein and Andreotti (2021) whose works is grounded in critical pedagogy and postcolonial theory, question such common understandings of GCE which foreground self-improvement and the development of leadership skills to save the world rather than addressing the economic and cultural roots of the inequalities in the way power and wealth/labor are distributed in a global complex and uncertain system. They challenge hegemonic discourses, the masking of global complexity, and the perpetuation in education of colonial ideologies, and they encourage us “to think otherwise” (Andreotti, 2006, p. 7).
			<br><br>
			Similarly, Helm and Hauck (2020) distinguish between hegemonic and non-hegemonic forms of virtual exchange (VE). VE refers to structured online collaborative learning between geographically and/or culturally diverse groups of students, aimed at fostering intercultural dialogue through digitally mediated project work. VE is a research-informed practice and serves as a valuable tool in advancing Internationalisation at Home in Higher Education, integrating intercultural dimensions into curricula, and expanding opportunities for global learning beyond physical mobility. 
			<br><br>
			Reljanovic Glimäng (2022) adds an additional conceptual layer to Helm and Hauck's distinction, namely the notion of safe (hegemonic) versus brave (non-hegemonic) spaces in VE where learners can engage in thinking otherwise.
			<br><br>
			Non-hegemonic, brave VE, then, is critical virtual exchange (CVE) which I propose as an ideal context for critical Global Citizenship Education in Andreotti’s (2006) sense, i.e. with notions of power, voice, and difference at its core. I will introduce a framework for CVE (Hauck, 2023; in press) that highlights what distinguishes this approach to Internationalisation at Home (Beelen and Jones, 2015; O’Dowd & Beelen, 2021) from VE as we know it, and will present exchange examples from both the Global North and the Global South that speak to the CVE agenda.

			<h3>Seiji Isotani</h3>
			<p>University of Sao Paulo / Harvard University
			<br />C5: ICCE Sub-Conference on Educational Gamification and Game-based Learning (EGG)</p>
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">Personalized Gamification Experiences: From Design to Impact</p>
			<p>
			The one-size-fits-all approach to designing gamification experiences has led to uneven results. While it may work well for some, it can demotivate others due to its failure to account for individual or domain-specific differences. This issue is particularly problematic in educational settings, where learning outcomes are strongly linked to student motivation and engagement. In response, personalized gamification offers a promising solution by tailoring learning experiences to individuals. However, several key questions must be addressed to achieve effective personalization: What specific elements should be used to adapt the design? How does gamification influence students, and how does its impact evolve over time? How can personalization be (semi-)automated to ensure scalability and efficiency? In this keynote, I will synthesize findings from multiple studies conducted by my group, exploring the impact of gamification on learning and motivation, as well as various strategies for personalization. These strategies include the use of player profiles and learning activity types to adapt gamification designs through machine learning. Our empirical studies indicate that personalized gamification can enhance students' flow experience, motivation, and learning outcomes. Additionally, we examine potential risks, such as gender bias in the design of gamification systems, which may lead to unintended consequences.
