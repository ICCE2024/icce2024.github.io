	  The ICCE C7 sub-conference on Practice‐driven Research, Teacher Professional Development and Policy of ICT in Education (PTP) welcomes contributions concerning research, diffusion and effective practices of ICT innovation in education. It focuses on issues regarding technological innovation, and related emerging pedagogical and methodological concerns. This theme based conference aims to explore issues regarding technological innovation to support practice-driven research and evidence based education in the context of sustainable practices in the classroom. It covers scalability issues appearing in teacher professional development when using technology and ICT in education and the area of policy of ICT in education, focusing particularly on formulating national and local policies, promoting instructional leadership of principals and heads of department. Additionally, the goal of this sub-conference is also to explore relationships of parents, students and teachers in the context of ICT in Education. Here, it is an important factor to identify work modes that allow a fruitful integration of all stakeholders in the learning process. The sub-conference aims to connect researchers in the Asia-Pacific region and other parts of the world to share scholarly findings and professional insights into the research, practice and policies on ICT in education. The C7 sub-conference focuses on, but is not limited to, the following areas:
