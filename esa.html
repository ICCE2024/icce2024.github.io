	  </h2>

      <article>
	  <h4>
        Introduction
      </h4>
	  <p>
		In 2007, the Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education (APSCE) established a financial aid and scholarship program known as the APSCE Merit Scholarship Award (MSA) that aimed at advancing the mission of fostering and sustaining a vibrant community of young researchers within the region — a key objective of the Society. For the past 16 years, the MSA supported more than 100 promising young leaders within the student community who lacked adequate funding to participate in ICCE.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Starting from the year 2024, this program is now officially recognized as the APSCE Excellence Scholarship Award (ESA), aligning more closely with its overarching goal of acknowledging and encouraging par excellence. This change was implemented to ensure a more inclusive recognition of outstanding students.
	  </p>

	  <h4>
		Eligibility Criteria for Applicants
	  </h4>
	  <ol>
		<li>Open to graduate students (Masters and Doctoral students) who will be attending ICCE 2024. Those who have graduated with a Master’s degree within the past 12 months from the date of the ICCE 2024 conference (25 November 2024) and are waiting to enroll in a PhD program may also be considered.</li>
		<li>Presenter and author of at least one accepted paper with overall favorable ratings from ICCE 2024 reviewers (e.g., fall in the "inclined to accept" or "definitely accept" category).</li>
	  </ol>
	  </article>
	  
	  <article>
	  <h4>
		Selection Criteria
	  </h4>
	  <p>
	  The ESA will prioritize applicants based on the following criteria, listed in ascending order of preference:
	  <ol>
		<li>Papers recommended by the paper review panel for Best Student Paper Award / Best Paper Award / Best Technical Paper Award.</li>
		<li>Papers accepted in the theme-based main conference (both Full or Short papers categories) will be given the highest priority. For papers accepted in other categories (e.g., posters in theme-based main conference) and other programs (i.e., workshops, DSC, WIPP, ES, and SATELUC), thorough consideration will be given to reviewer comments and evaluations.</li>
		<li>Contributed to the research community in any form, or have participated in prior ICCE(s).</li>
		<li>Applicant's financial circumstances will be taken into account during the final selection process, particularly when there is a strong pool of candidates vying for the ESA.</li>
		<li>Those who have not received subsidized support through APSCE for attending past ICCEs will also be given priority.</li>
	  </ol>
