      <p>
        The seven theme-based sub-conferences will foster the building of strong research communities within the broader field of Computers in Education and Educational Technology. The meta-conference umbrella will play not only the dual role of allowing researchers to enhance their identity in their thematic research communities, but also allowing cross-disciplinary interactions to help broaden the scope of and inspire future innovative research.

      <p>We welcome contributions that report accomplished research as well as work in progress. Papers that describe innovative architectures and models (e.g. Deep-Learning-Based Models), discuss results from AIED/ITS systems in use, and present evaluations of AIED/ITS systems are strongly encouraged. The conference also welcomes research works dealing with innovative ideas (theoretical or conceptual) that have the potential for significant impact on future research in AIED/ITS field.</p>
