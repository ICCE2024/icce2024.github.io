        Call for Main Conference Papers
      </h2>
      <p>
          In response to emerging research diversity, ICCE 2024 will be a meta-conference, comprising of seven interrelated theme-based conferences. ICCE 2024 will be a conference for researchers in the Asia-Pacific region to connect with international research communities for the worldwide dissemination and sharing of ideas for research in the field of Computers in Education. Seven interrelated sub-conferences on specialized themes, each of which is organized by a program committee appointed by the respective Special Interest Group (SIG), will be part of the five-day conference schedule.<br><br>In addition, the conference will include keynote speakers, theme-based invited speakers, expert panels on topics of current interest, and pre-conference tutorials, workshops, Doctoral Student Consortia (DSC), Early Career Workshop (ECW). Researchers, graduate or undergraduate students, policymakers and educators are invited to participate in all aspects of the conference.<br><br>
        Accepted papers in the main conference, Workshops, Work-in-Progress Posters (WIPP), Doctoral Student Consortia (DSC), Early Career Workshop (ECW), Extended Summaries (ES), and Showcase of Advancements in Technology-Enhanced Learning in Underrepresented Countries (SATELUC) will be published in proceedings, which will be submitted to Elsevier for inclusion in Scopus. Proceedings of the main conference (excluding posters) will also be submitted to Thomson Reuters for inclusion in the Conference Proceedings Citation Index. Authors of accepted distinguished full papers will be invited to submit extended versions of the papers for consideration of publication in Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (RPTEL), the official academic journal of the Asia Pacific Society for Computers in Education.<br><br>

      <p>
        The seven theme-based sub-conferences will foster the building of strong research communities within the broader field of Computers in Education and Educational Technology. The meta-conference umbrella will play not only the dual role of allowing researchers to enhance their identity in their thematic research communities, but also allowing cross-disciplinary interactions to help broaden the scope of and inspire future innovative research.
