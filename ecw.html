      <h3>
        About ECW
      </h3>
	  <article>
	  <p>
		Held in conjunction with the ICCE 2024 (https://icce2024.ateneo.edu/), the Early Career Workshop (ECW) is a face-to-face event that offers an opportunity for early career scholars in the learning technology field to discuss their research, early-career challenges and career directions with peers and senior advisors.
	  </p>
	  </article>
 
      <h3>
        Objectives
      </h3>
	  <article>
	  <p>
		The ECW aims to add value to the early-career participants in, but not limited to, the following aspects:
	  </p>
	  <div>
	  <ul>
		<li>To develop academic support networks among peers, between early career scholars and more senior scholars, and the connection between early career scholars and the APSCE Special Interest Groups (SIGs) related to their respective research areas;</li>
		<li>To be engaged in negotiation and exchange, thereby developing greater awareness and appreciation, in acting strategically about one’s academic career, including the development of a thriving research program, grant applications and journal publications, balancing multiple requirements (research, teaching, university/international services), building local and international relationships to maximize future career opportunities, getting promotion and tenure, etc.</li>
	  </ul>
	  </div>
	  <p>
	  If the time and resources permit, a special program component may be arranged to offer career advice to early-career scholars at non-faculty or non-tenurable (e.g., postdoctoral fellows or lecturers), or non-academic positions who are seeking and applying for tenurable research positions.
	  </p>
	  </article>	  

      <h3>
        Program Overview
      </h3>
	  <article>
	  <p>
		The ECW will be a half-day or shorter event (the length will depend on the number of participants) held during one of the pre-conference days of ICCE 2024 (November 25 or 26). Several established researchers of the field will serve as the advisors of the event.
	  </p>
	  <div>
	  <ul>
		<li>begin with participants and advisors introducing themselves;</li>
		<li>followed by an academic and professional development panel where each advisor will give a talk on specific topic(s) on early career development, such as development of research program and grant applications, building networks, paper writing and publications, promotion and tenure, balancing research/teaching/service requirements, recruiting and supervising graduate students, etc.;</li>
		<li>next, each advisor will facilitate a small group of participants who are working in the same or similar research area to discuss topics raised at the panel and individual participants’ career needs.</li>
	  </ul>
	  </div>
	  <p>More details about the workshop program will be released later.
