			<span style="font-weight:bold">Ateneo Art Gallery</span>
			<br />
			The <a href="https://ateneoartgallery.com/">Ateneo Art Gallery</a> is the first museum of Philippine Modern Art. It is the University’s museum, now located in Areté. The Gallery is open from Mondays to Saturdays from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. ICCE participants may visit the Gallery for free during these times by showing their ICCE name badge.
			<br /><br />
			The Ateneo Art Gallery was established in 1960 through Fernando Zóbel’s bequest to the Ateneo of his collection of works by key Filipino post-war artists.
			<br /><br />
			Through the years, other philanthropists and artists followed Zobel’s initiative, filling in the gaps so that the collection now surveys every Philippine art movement in the post-war era: from neo-realism and abstract expressionism to today’s post-modern hybrid tendencies.
			<br /><br />
			Now in its new home in the Arts Wing of Areté, the Ateneo Art Gallery has expanded the scope of its exhibition programs to feature more of its permanent collection at the upper-ground and second-floor galleries, presented in different thematic contexts. The third-floor galleries are ideal spaces for more contemporary and experimental art projects such as the annual Ateneo Art Awards as well as survey and historical exhibitions. The Ben Chan ArtSuite, a multi-purpose venue, provides a space dedicated for educational activities and other public programs such as workshops, lectures, seminars, and film screenings.
