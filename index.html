          conferences. ICCE 2024 will be a conference for researchers in the
          Asia-Pacific region to connect with international research communities
          for the worldwide dissemination and sharing of ideas for research in the
          field of Computers in Education.<br/><br/>Seven interrelated
          sub-conferences on specialized themes, each of which is organized by a
          program committee appointed by the respective Special Interest Group
          (SIG), will be part of the five-day conference schedule. In addition,

          speakers, expert panels on topics of current interest, and
          pre-conference tutorials, workshops, Doctoral Student Consortia (DSC)
          and Early Career Workshop (ECW).<br/><br/>Researchers, graduate or

          </li>
          <li>
            Short paper (5-6 pages)

      <br>
      <p>
        Please refer to the submission guidelines before submitting your papers
        and download the latest version of the Paper Template file (Word
        version) in preparing your manuscript. Please note that the paper
        template has been revised – please download the latest version of the
        template.<br><br>
        We strongly suggest that you use the paper template and do the change directly on it by typing and copying/pasting pure text in it. In such case, your paper’s format can be same like the sample paper. The conference practices a single-blind review process, i.e., the authors of the submitting papers will not know who their referees are, while the referees will be aware of the authors of the papers that they are reviewing. Anonymization is no longer required in the submitted manuscripts. Please note that the paper template has been revised please download the latest version of the template instead of reusing the previous year template.
