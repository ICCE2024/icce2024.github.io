        The organizers invite proposals for workshops and interactive events to be held in conjunction with the 32nd International Conference on Computers in Education (ICCE 2024), which is organized by the Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education (APSCE). ICCE 2024 will be held on November 25-29, 2024, from Monday to Friday in Manila, Philippines. Pre-conference events (e.g., Doctoral Student Consortium, workshops, and tutorials) will be conducted on the first two days, and the main conference will begin on November 27th, 2024. Accepted papers in the workshops and interactive events will be published in proceedings, which will be submitted to Elsevier for inclusion in Scopus. The proposals should be submitted as <span style="font-weight:bold">a single PDF file</span> by email to the Workshop/Tutorial/Interactive Event Coordination Co-Chairs:

        Call for Workshop Proposals

      <p>
        The purpose of the workshops is to provide participants with a less formal setting to exchange intellectual ideas and to share practical experiences on focused topics or emerging sub-areas in technology-enhanced learning. Workshops can be conducted in the form of:
      </p>
	  <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            mini-conferences with paper presentations; or
          </li>
          <li>
            discussion-oriented events that could involve collaborative design or data analysis activities.
          </li>
        </ul>
		</div>
		<article>
		<p>Researchers and practitioners from all areas of computers in education are invited to submit proposals for review. Proposals of workshops organized or endorsed by specific Special Interest Groups (SIG) under Asia Pacific Society on Computers in Education are welcome too (this should be explicitly stated in the proposal). The organizers of approved workshops are expected to define the workshop focus, gather and review submissions, and decide upon the final program content. Once the workshop proposals are approved, the workshop organizers may proceed to issue calls for papers (for mini-conference- style workshops) or recruit participants (for discussion-oriented workshops). Please note that at this stage, you are only required to define the workshop focus and identify POTENTIAL participants or papers. To avoid confusion, please initiate the paper submission and review process only when the workshop proposal is approved. A workshop proposal should not exceed 3 pages and should contain the following information:</p>
	  <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Title of the workshop
          </li>
          <li>
            Style of the workshop (i.e. mini-conference or discussion style)
          </li>
          <li>
            A brief description of the workshop topic
          </li>
          <li>
            A draft of the Call for Workshop Papers
          </li>
          <li>
            Names, affiliations, email addresses and short biographies of the workshop organizers
          </li>
          <li>
            A list of prospective members of the workshop program committee
          </li>
          <li>
            Expected number of attendees and the planned length of the workshop (i.e., 1/2 day or full day)
          </li>
        </ul>
		</div>
		<p>In addition, in order to foster effective intellectual exchange, each mini conference-style workshop must eventually accept at least 4 papers from at least 2 different countries or regions. Similarly, each discussion-oriented workshop should have at least 4 participants (other than the organizers) from at least 2 different countries or regions registering for participation. ICCE International Program Committee retains the right to cancel or merge individual workshops that do not meet this criterion. Accepted papers will appear in one volume of the workshop proceedings with ISBN and will be indexed by Elsevier Bibliographic Database. Published workshop papers will be made available on the official ICCE 2024 website.

        The goal of the interactive events is to offer the participants the opportunities for interactions with innovative educational technologies and tools through manipulation, problem-solving, discussion, and engagement. An interactive event typically takes place within 1-2 hours, depending on the venue and overall scheduling constraints. Registered ICCE participants are NOT required to pay additional fees for the interactive events. (Note that honorarium or discount for registration is not considered for conducting an interactive event. A certificate will be presented to the instructor(s) of the interactive event).

	  <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        The organizers invite proposals for tutorials to be held in conjunction with the ICCE 2024. The proposed tutorials should benefit the diverse audience, including academics, practitioners and policy makers in developing the research, development or practitioner skills needed in the field of technology-enhanced learning. Tutorials are instructive in nature and often focus on specific topics. Potential topics of tutorials could be pertaining (but not restricted) to: established learning theories or frameworks, research methods, technology-enhanced pedagogy or assessment methods, specific technologies or tools, other researcher-related skills (e.g., literature review, academic writing). The organizers also encourage tutorials that include a hands-on session, allowing participants to experience useful tools.
