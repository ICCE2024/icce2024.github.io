      <p>
        The ICCE C1 sub-conference on AIED/ITS & Adaptive Learning focuses on research and development of interactive and adaptive learning environments for learners of all ages, across all domains. The conference provides opportunities for the cross-fertilization of knowledge and ideas from researchers in many fields that make up this interdisciplinary research area, including artificial intelligence, computer science, cognitive science, education, learning sciences, educational technology, psychology, philosophy, sociology, anthropology and linguistics. It also includes many domain-specific areas for which AIED/ITS systems have been designed and built, including ITS for ill-defined domains. Possible topics in the context of AIED/ITS systems that papers may address include (but are not limited to):
